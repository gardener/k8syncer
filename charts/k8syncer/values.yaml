      # For rendering the rbac rules, the resource name is required.
      # It is usually the lowercase plural form of the kind.
      # The chart tries to guess the plural by
      # - appending an 's' to the kind
      # - if the kind ends with 'y', replacing the 'y' with 'ies'
      # If none of these guesses results in the correct resource name,
      # you have to manually overwrite it by specifying 'resource' here.
